TerminalApp Gen 2 - Update 6 (Beta) - Changelog
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
I am continuing the release of a beta version of every update to make sure there aren't any bugs on the actual release.

__New Features__
- Added 6 NEW COMMANDS which are: UpdateHighScoresIn, UpdateHighScoresOut, DispHighScores, DispConfigFile, CreateConfig and CPUBench.
- Added a class-based system for high scores so code could look neater and more efficient (please file feedback if issues were found with high scores).
- This update also introduces a new configuration file way of saving game scores and settings! Instead of using several files for several values, all contents are placed in one singular configuration file. Please file any feedback if there are issues with high scores not saving or being overwritten.
- DRASTICALLY improved time accuracy of the stopwatch command. It now used std functions and measures in ten-thousandth of a second.
- Source code neatness improvements

__Bugfixes__
- Fixed an issue where typing anything on the starting screen of TerminalAppGen2 other than the Enter key would glitch out the command input.
- Fixed an issue where your high score wouldn't be saved when you exit from any match in the Car Dodge pause menu.
- Fixed a couple of issues where some commands such as Sleep and Beep wouldn't exit when inputting a character (by removing the exit from character option; the issue was by design)

__Known Issues__
- There still seems to be an issue with FileParse repeating the wrong lines in some cases. This may be fixed soon.
